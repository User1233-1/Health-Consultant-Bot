 
**Project Title: Health-Consultant-Bot**

The Website that is currently Working  : https://sites.google.com/view/healthconsultantbot/home

**Problem Statement**:A lot of people face some problems which affect them physically as well as mentally. For physical problems people feel the need to visit a doctor or someone who could guide them regarding their health. But For Mental issues it gets very difficult for a person to express his/her thoughts or feelings. 
 
We as human beings love to interact and convey our thoughts but getting someone right beside us is not always possible so there must be something such as a chatbot that can bridge the gap of a person and can provide justified solutions to the questions  asked.
 
So here , I have introduced a user-friendly bot which can be a great friend also in our leisure time . It's a Health Chatbot which  guides us through its knowledge base by providing suitable answers as per the questions asked. 
The bot has been preloaded with FAQs which are commonly asked by people in regard to Mental Peace and Psychological health i.e. Stress, Anxiety etc.

Azure Services used : I have used Azure QnA bot maker for this project it uses the Knowledge Base that is created on the azure platform. Then it has been embedded and linked to a channel which is google sites where it is working Completely Fine.

AS the project wasnt working with Web App and Static Web App and was constantly throwing errors so I was bound to embed the code in Google Sites . And it is a full fledged Working Project .
